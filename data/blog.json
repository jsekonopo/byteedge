Why?</p><h3>The PoC Trap</h3><p>Most companies start with 'What can we do with AI?' instead of 'What business problem needs solving?'. This leads to Proofs of Concept (PoCs) that are technically impressive but operationally irrelevant.</p><h3>The ByteEdge Framework</h3><p>We approach AI deployment backwards: from the P&L statement to the model architecture.</p><ul><li><strong>Define the Metric:</strong> Is it Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)? Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)? Lifetime Value (LTV)?</li><li><strong>Establish the Baseline:</strong> What is the current manual process costing you?</li><li><strong>Model the Unit Economics:</strong> If the AI costs $0.05 per inference, does the math work at scale?</li></ul><p>By enforcing this discipline, we turn AI from a cost center into a profit engine.</p>",

You can:</p><ol><li>Deploy Next.js in front of your legacy content using <strong>Rewrites</strong>.</li><li>Carve out specific routes (e.g., <code>/dashboard</code>, <code>/checkout</code>) to be handled by the new app.</li><li>Proxy everything else back to the legacy system.</li></ol><p>This allows you to ship value in weeks, not years.</p>",
